Dear Aarushi,

Thank you for auditioning for CPYO.  We are pleased with your audition and after deliberation, we feel that you would be best playing Flute 1 in the Senior Orchestra.

Beginning September 6, our program meets every Friday evening from 6:30 pm to 9:30 pm in the Joan Pisani Community Center, 19655 Allendale Ave, Saratoga, CA. 95070.

It is also with great pleasure that we announce CPYO will be touring Austria in 2020. We will be exploring and performing in the area that Mozart was born in and where Haydn composed many of this famous works.

A separate email will be sent with a link registration and payment information.

CPYO requests that all orchestra members attend a week-long Overnight Summer Camp from Sunday, 8/4/19, to Sat. 8/10/19, at Walden West in Saratoga.

It is CPYO policy that each member family will receive two free tickets to our regular concerts. Additional tickets are available for a nominal charge for those who need more than two. Occasionally, orchestra members’ families may be asked to purchase tickets for “special events” that may be added to the performance schedule. Special events include benefits, anniversary and/or guest artist concerts that may be scheduled at the discretion of our Director and the CPYO Board. Your ticket purchase to these events help defray the added costs of the venues selected for such events.

Once again, congratulations! We look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Anh Tuan Huynh

Orchestra Manager
